The site could also integrate and embed the social media directly on the page. \n\n* **Insight**: People are more likely to visit your site between 9 AM and 4 PM on a weekday (i.e. during working hours). \n  + **Recommendations**: \n    - Post social media content and email campaigns during these times.\n    - Plan when to make changes to your website\n    - Plan site maintenance outside of these hours \n    \n* **Insight**: Only 6.4% of total Sessions involved a Mobile Device.\nOne reason for this could be that the website is not mobile friendly. We could conduct a survey to ask users which device they prefer to use on the website and why.\n  + **Recommendations**: As of November 2022, about half of worldwide web traffic came from mobile devices. So it is imporant that the site is mobile friendly. \n    - Make website responsive to different mobile devices screen sizes.\n    - Optimise online forms for mobiles\n    - Improve mobile navigation\n    - Optimize mobile page speed\n    \n* **Insight**: The average session duration is 5 minutes 36 seconds\n  + **Recommendations**: An AI Chatbot or live chat can help increase session duration and help users get answers quickly \n  \n  \n#### Appendix\n* [https://drudesk.com/blog/build-municipal-website](\"https://drudesk.com/blog/build-municipal-website\")\n* [https://www.monsterinsights.com/proven-ways-to-increase-your-returning-visitor-rate/](\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/proven-ways-to-increase-your-returning-visitor-rate/\")\n* [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic](\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic\")\n* [https://www.vertical-leap.uk/blog/9-reasons-website-doesnt-work-mobile/](\"https://www.vertical-leap.uk/blog/9-reasons-website-doesnt-work-mobile/\")","metadata":{}}]}
